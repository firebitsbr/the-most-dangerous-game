### Technical Sources

---

# What to Analyze: Malware

## Malware Sources
- VXShare
- VirusTotal
- Malwr.com

## Reversing
- C2 Info
- Destinctive Strings
- Developer Artifacts

---

class: middle

# What to Analyze: Passive DNS
- The most useful tool for infrastructure research
- What resolved to what, and when?
- DNSDB (Farsight), PassiveTotal, & VirusTotal

# What to Analyze: Whois

# How to Keep Tracking

---

class: middle
# Threat Library
- [CRITs](https://crits.github.io/) is popular, [MISP](http://www.misp-project.org/) also
- Lighter solutions (like wikis) often work
- Market hasn't fully addressed this

---

# Web Monitoring Systems
- [Netflix Scumblr](https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr) Meta Search (Works alongside Sketchy)
- [Recorded Future](https://www.recordedfuture.com/)
- Lots of custom development

---

# Malware Monitoring
- [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) is King
- Malware feeds with lots of custom internal solutions
- [Maltrieve](https://github.com/krmaxwell/maltrieve), [Viper](https://github.com/viper-framework/viper), & [Cuckoo](http://www.cuckoosandbox.org/)

---

# Internal Logging
- Firewall, IDS, & Proxy
- Web, mail, & DNS
- Authentication & Audit

## Requests For Intelligence
### Shortest form possible with fastest turn around

## Short Form Products
### Intermediate products to support incident response

## Long Form Products
### Comprehensive “All Source” intelligence products

???

- RFI should be answering one specific question
- Short Forms: INdicator heavy
- Long Forms: Require a mature team
